## Books

- [Cocoa Programming for OS X](https://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-OS-Ranch-Guides/dp/0134076958) - Somewhat out of date, but filled with lots of essential Mac programming information, with examples in Swift


## About

This document is maintained by me, [Isaac Halvorson](https://hisaac.net). I started this after making the jump from iOS development to macOS development, and noticing a distinct lack of good content pertaining specifically to developing for the Mac platform. After some chatter recently about this on Twitter, I figured it was high time someone started to catalog these things somewhere.
