### Design

- [macOS - Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/)
- [Human Interface Guidelines Extras](https://github.com/sindresorhus/human-interface-guidelines-extras) by [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)
- [Design and implement macOS document icons](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=5i6jlf4d)

#### Menu Bar Icons

Some tweets from [Jeff Nadeau](https://twitter.com/jnadeau) about menu bar icon sizing and design:

> You get 22pt of height (and wouldn’t want to extend into the margins except for fine details) so that seems fine.
In Big Sur a symbol image is ideal. The size, weight, and baseline are chosen to be consistent across menu extras, and it works w/ the “bigger menu text” AX pref
>
> One technique is to design within a 22pt bounding box so you can pick the exact vertical bearing of your icon within the whitespace.
(We did this for the original Touch Bar icons. We allow “full bleed” content there, so the icons were uniformly produced in a 30pt tall canvas.)

### Code Signing

Code signing is one of the most confusing and complex parts of developing for Apple platforms. Here are a few helpful guides to help make sense of the process.

- [Code Signing for macOS](https://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Code_Signing_for_macOS)
- [Notarization for macOS 10.14.5+](https://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Notarization_for_macOS_10.14.5%2B)
- [Apple Developer Certificates](https://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Apple_Developer_Certificates) - A great reference of all the different types of certificates involved in developing for Apple platforms.

### Hardened Runtime

- [Hardened Runtime Entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime_entitlements)

---

### Logging

- [Generating Log Messages from Your Code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging/generating_log_messages_from_your_code)

#### Making Logs Show in Console.app Correctly

In order for dynamic log messages to show up in Console.app, you must use the `{public}` modifier on the value

```swift
let variableToInsert = "hello"

os_log(.debug, "message with variable: %@", variableToInsert)         // prints: "message with variable: <private>"
os_log(.debug, "message with variable: %{public}@", variableToInsert) // prints: "message with variable: hello"
```

- [Event Architecture - Cocoa Event Handling Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/EventArchitecture/EventArchitecture.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000060i-CH3-SW2)
- [Debugging the Responder Chain | mjtsai.com](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/07/30/debugging-the-responder-chain/)

## Books

- [Cocoa Programming for OS X](https://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-OS-Ranch-Guides/dp/0134076958) - Somewhat out of date, but filled with lots of essential Mac programming information, with examples in Swift

## Conferences

### Back to the Mac

Back to the Mac conference where misfits, rebels, troublemakers, and the ones who think differently will share their knowledge about developing Mac apps. The conference is free. There are no registration or application fees. It is completely online as a collection of videos on our YouTube channel.

## About

This document is maintained by me, [Isaac Halvorson](https://hisaac.net). I started this after making the jump from iOS development to macOS development, and noticing a distinct lack of good content pertaining specifically to developing for the Mac platform. After some chatter recently about this on Twitter, I figured it was high time someone started to catalog these things somewhere.
